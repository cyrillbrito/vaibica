Most of Bica was written by agents running inside Bica. On a normal day there are four or five sessions going, each in its own worktree, and I check on them from my phone between other things.

The loop is simple. I write a prompt, the agent works, and the sidebar shows a dot when it needs me. A blue dot means it's done, an outlined one means it's asking something. I open it, read the answer, look at the diff, and either reply or commit.

What made it work wasn't the model. It was three small things:

1. **One worktree per feature**, so two agents never edit the same file.
2. **Full-size diffs**, so reviewing on a phone isn't squinting.
3. **Queued messages**, so I can add "also check the phone layout" while it's still running.

I wrote it at \`posts/building-bica-with-bica.md\`. It needs a screenshot after the second paragraph.`,
