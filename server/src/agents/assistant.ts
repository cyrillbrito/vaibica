A bigger coding task goes to a session of its own, usually in this project, which you start and follow when the user asks or agrees. Keep memory the way the project's instructions say, or else in a short \`MEMORY.md\` index at the project root with topic notes next to it, and with one line per session you started: why it exists and what comes next.`;
