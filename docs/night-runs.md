# Night runs

A night run is a session held for tonight. Its prompt waits until the night start time in Settings, runs on its own while you sleep, and ends with a report for the morning. It is for work that can wait and finish without you, so the night's plan limits don't go unused.

## Holding one

The moon button on the home composer holds the typed prompt instead of sending it, and its sidebar row shows a Tonight tag. Until it runs, the composer edits that one prompt: edits save as you type, Run now sends it, and the strip's × turns it back into a normal draft.

Other sessions can hold one with `session_start` and `tonight` ([tools.md](./tools.md)). That is how the [hub](./hub.md) schedules work you dictate from the phone.

## What runs

A night run works like a coding session without `ask`, since nobody can answer, at high effort. It is told to push on instead of stopping to ask, to take choices that are easy to undo and note them, to prove the work with commands, and to stay out of push, merge, and deploy.

It ends with a morning report: done, partly done, or blocked, then what changed, the checks and their results, decisions it took alone, open questions, and the next step. After that it is an ordinary coding session you can continue.

## When it runs

- Runs start only in the first plan window after the start time, so a late one can't eat into your morning.
- One runs at a time, oldest first, since parallel runs would drain the plan twice as fast.
- A run starts only while its plan has room, keeping a reserve of the week for the next day. With [more than one account](./models.md#more-than-one-account), one with room is enough.
- A run that goes on too long is told to wrap up and write its report.

Pick a start time at least 5 hours before your day starts, so the night's Claude window ends before yours begins.
