# Projects and workspaces

A project is a folder on the dev machine you want agents to work in, usually a git repo. A workspace is the exact folder a session runs in: the project's main folder, or one of its git worktrees. Worktrees let parallel agents work without stepping on each other's files.

```
Project  vaibica
├─ main folder        ← sessions: "fix sidebar", "hi"
├─ worktree: projects ← sessions: "add project picker"
└─ worktree: diffs    ← sessions: "changes panel"
```

## Adding a project

Add project opens a folder browser on the dev machine, with git repos marked.

## Where a session starts

The home page's workspace picker searches every project's main folder and worktrees by name, branch, ticket key, or pull request number. Empty, it shows the places you used last. + Worktree on a project, or ⌘Enter, starts in a new worktree instead. Pages that show a workspace offer a new session there too.

## Worktrees

- Git is the source of truth, so worktrees made in a terminal show up too.
- New worktree makes one per session. The session's name becomes the branch and a folder next to the project's, and the branch starts from the freshly fetched default branch.
- Setup runs in a terminal in the new worktree: the project's `setup` command, or an install guessed from the lockfile.
- Remove worktree, in a worktree's menu, deletes its folder and local branch, archives its sessions, and closes its terminals. A worktree whose pull request merged or closed shows it as a button too. It asks first when that would lose uncommitted files or unmerged commits. A branch whose pull request was squash-merged counts as merged.

## Chats

A chat is a session with no project. Each starts in a new empty folder in `~/.bica/chats`, with its own git repo, so the agent can still write files. Chats are listed last in the sidebar.

## Pull requests

Each branch shows its pull request's number and state, and a click opens it on GitHub. Bica asks the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for your own pull requests and matches them by branch. Without `gh`, nothing shows.

## The sidebar

The sidebar starts with the [hub](./hub.md), then groups sessions by project and workspace, with each workspace's terminals and kept files above its sessions. ⌘B hides it.

- A workspace's header opens its workspace page: the workspace card, files, and Git ([files.md](./files.md)).
- Drag a project's header to reorder projects.
- Branch names drop their prefix, and a leading ticket key becomes a small tag that opens the ticket when the project has a `tickets` link in `.data/projects.json`.
- Workspaces with nothing open drop into Parked, so a worktree waiting on review stays out of the way. Pin project keeps a main folder listed.
- Archived sessions sit in a collapsed section at the bottom.

## Safety

The folder browser can list any folder the server can read. That is fine only because Bica is reached from localhost or a private network.
